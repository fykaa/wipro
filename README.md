**Author**: Fyka Ansari

Welcome to the world of Kubernetes and its vibrant contributor community! In this blog post, we'll be shining a spotlight on the Special Interest Group for Contributor Experience (SIG ContribEx), an essential component of the Kubernetes project.

SIG ContribEx in Kubernetes is responsible for developing and maintaining a healthy and productive community of contributors to the project. This involves identifying and addressing bottlenecks that may hinder the project's growth and feature velocity, such as pull request latency and the number of open pull requests and issues!

The SIG ContribEx works to improve the overall contributor experience by creating and maintaining guidelines, tools, and processes that facilitate collaboration and communication among contributors. They also focus on community building and support, including outreach programs and mentorship initiatives to onboard and retain new contributors.

Ultimately, the role of SIG ContribEx is to foster a welcoming and inclusive environment that encourages contribution and supports the long-term sustainability of the Kubernetes project.

In this blog post, [Fyka Ansari](https://twitter.com/1fyka) interviews [Kaslin Fields](https://twitter.com/kaslinfields), a DevRel Engineer at Google who serves as the Lead of SIG ContribEx and [Madhav Jivrajani](https://twitter.com/MadhavJivrajani), a Software Engineer at VMWare who serves as the SIG ContribEx Tech Lead. This interview covers various aspects of SIG ContribEx, including current initiatives, exciting developments, and how interested individuals can get involved and contribute to the group. It provides valuable insights into the workings of SIG ContribEx and highlights the importance of its role in the Kubernetes ecosystem.

### About our Interviewee

**Fyka:** I am super excited to have a chat with you all! I’d love to learn more about your experiences and insights as a member of SIG ContribEx. To kick things off, could you share a bit about your background and how you first became involved in the Kubernetes ecosystem and SIG ContribEx?

**Kaslin:** I first got involved in the Kubernetes ecosystem through my mentor, Jonathan Rippy, who introduced me to containers during my early days in tech. Eventually, I transitioned to a team working with containers, which sparked my interest in Kubernetes when it was announced. While researching Kubernetes in that role, I eagerly sought opportunities to engage with the containers/Kubernetes community. It was not until my subsequent job that I found a suitable role to contribute consistently. I joined SIG ContribEx, specifically in the Contributor Comms subproject, to both deepen my knowledge of Kubernetes and support the community better.

**Madhav:** My journey with Kubernetes began when I was a student, searching for interesting and exciting projects to work on. With my peers, I discovered open source and attended The New Contributor Workshop organized by the Kubernetes community. The workshop not only provided valuable insights into the community structure but also gave me a sense of warmth and welcome, which motivated me to join and remain involved. I realized that collaboration is at the heart of open-source communities, and to get answers and support, I needed to contribute and do my part. I started working on issues in ContribEx, particularly focusing on GitHub automation, despite not fully understanding the task at first. This led to a rewarding experience, and I continued to contribute to various technical and non-technical aspects of the project, finding it to be one of the most fulfilling experiences in my life.

**Faeka:** That's such an inspiration in itself! I'm sure beginners who are reading this got the ultimate motivation to take their first steps. Embracing the Learning journey, seeking mentorship, and engaging with the Kubernetes community can pave the way for exciting opportunities in the tech industry. Your stories proved the importance of starting small and being proactive, just like Madhav said Don't be afraid to take on tasks, even if you're uncertain at first.

###  Primary Goals and Scope

**Faeka:** Given your experience as a member of SIG ContribEx, could you tell us a bit about the group's primary goals and initiatives? Its current focus areas? What do you see as the scope of SIG ContribEx and the impact it has on the Kubernetes community?

**Kaslin:** SIG ContribEx's primary goals are to simplify the contributions of Kubernetes contributors and foster a welcoming community. It collaborates with other Kubernetes SIGs, such as planning the Contributor Summit at KubeCon, ensuring it meets the needs of various groups. The group's impact is evident in projects like updating org membership policies and managing critical platforms like Zoom, YouTube, and Slack. Its scope encompasses making the contributor experience smoother and supporting the overall Kubernetes community.

**Madhav:** The Kubernetes project has vertical SIGs and cross-cutting SIGs, ContribEx is a deeply cross-cutting SIG, impacting virtually every area of the Kubernetes community. _Adding to Kaslin,_ Sustainability in the Kubernetes project and community are critical now more than ever, it plays a central role in addressing critical issues, such as maintainer succession, by facilitating cohorts for SIGs to train experienced community members to take on leadership roles. Excellent Examples include SIG CLI and SIG Apps, leading to the onboarding of new reviewers. Additionally, SIG ContribEx is essential in managing GitHub automation tools, including bots and commands used by contributors for interacting with Prow and other automation (label syncing, group and GitHub team management etc).

### Beginner's Guide!

**Faeka:** I remember my conversation with Kaslin when I first joined the community & sought guidance on contributing. Your support with swift answers to all my doubts was instrumental in getting me started.

Please share some Tips for folks who want to contribute into Kubernetes for the first time. What will be the benefit for them to start with SIG ContribEx? What do you think sets us apart as a particularly beginner-friendly SIG? Why would you recommend it to new and existing contributors? And what exciting opportunities are available for beginners to get involved?

**Kaslin:** If you want to contribute to Kubernetes for the first time, it can be overwhelming to know where to start. A good option is to join SIG ContribEx as it offers great opportunities to know and serve the community. Within SIG ContribEx, various subprojects allow you to explore different parts of the Kubernetes project while you learn how contributions work. Once you know a bit more, it’s common for you to move to other SIGs within the project, and we think that’s wonderful. While many newcomers look for "good first issues" to start with, these opportunities can be scarce and get claimed quickly. Instead, the real benefit lies in attending meetings and getting to know the community. As you learn more about the project and the people involved, you'll be better equipped to offer your help, and the community will be more inclined to seek your assistance when needed. As a co-lead for the Contributor Comms subproject, I can confidently say that it's an excellent place for beginners to get involved. We have supportive leads and particularly beginner-friendly projects too.

**Madhav:** To begin, read the [SIG README](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-contributor-experience/README.md) on GitHub, which provides an overview of the projects the SIG manages. While attending meetings is beneficial for all SIGs, it's especially recommended for SIG ContribEx, as each subproject gets dedicated slots for updates and areas that need help. If you can't attend in real-time due to time zone differences, you can catch the meeting recordings or [Notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K3vjCZ9C3LwYrOJOhztQtFuDQCe-urv-ewx1bI8IPVQ/edit?usp=sharing) later.

### Skills you'll acquire!

**Faeka:** What skills are sought when recruiting new contributors to SIG ContribEx, ranging from enthusiasm to mastery? Also, what skills can contributors expect to acquire while working with SIG ContribEx?

**Kaslin:** Skills folks need to have or will acquire vary depending on what area of ContribEx they work upon. Even within a subproject, a range of skills can be useful and/or developed. For example, the tech lead role involves technical tasks and overseeing automation, while the social media lead role requires excellent communication skills. Working with SIG ContribEx allows contributors to acquire various skills based on their chosen subproject. By participating in meetings, listening, learning, and taking on tasks related to their interests, they can develop and hone these skills. Some subprojects may require more specialized skills, like program management for the mentoring project, but all contributors can benefit from offering their talents to help teach others and contribute to the community.

### Sub-Projects under SIG ContribEx

**Faeka:** SIG ContribEx has several smaller projects. Can you tell me about the specific aims of any of these projects and how they've helped the Kubernetes community? Also, I'd like to hear about any notable contributions and impact these teams have created.

### Accomplishments

**Faeka:** With that said, any SIG-related accomplishment that you’re proud of?

**Kaslin:** I'm proud of the accomplishments made by SIG ContribEx and its contributors in supporting the community. Some of the recent achievements include:

1.  Establishment of the elections subproject: Kubernetes is a massive project, and ensuring smooth leadership transitions is crucial. The contributors in this subproject organize fair and consistent elections, which helps keep the project running effectively.
    
2.  New issue triage process: With such a large open-source project like Kubernetes, there's always a lot of work to be done. To ensure things progress safely, we implemented new labels and updated functionality for issue triage using our PROW tool. This reduces bottlenecks in the workflow and allows leaders to accomplish more.
    
3.  New org membership requirements: Becoming an org member in Kubernetes can be overwhelming for newcomers. We view org membership as a significant milestone for contributors aiming to take on leadership roles. We recently updated the rules to automatically remove privileges from inactive members, making sure that the right people have access to the necessary tools and responsibilities.
    

Overall, these accomplishments have greatly benefited our fellow contributors and strengthened the Kubernetes community.
